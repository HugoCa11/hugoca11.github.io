									<p>
										Cyber Attack is the final project that we will present at VFS. This is a team project that's beeing developed using <b>Unreal Engine 5</b> where me and other three classmates have been working on since 
										February 2022. It consists on a multiplayer VR game where the players have to retake the control of a spaceship by hacking the AI that previously 
										ejected them to the outer space.
										<br>
										<br>

										To achieve this, the players will take turns, like in a boardgame, to control robots on the spaceship and use them to destroy the robots controlled 
										by the AI of the spaceship and get “Data” points that will be used to hack it, but this is not an easy task. The AI will use its robots to attack 
										the ones controlled by the players, but that’s not all, the AI also can hack players by creating random situations where the players can lose time of 
										their turn or spawn more enemy robots on the spaceship and in the worst scenario, they can be teleported to the main servers or as we call it “The Maze”.
										<br>
										<br>

										In “The Maze”, the players need to grab a gun to protect themselves against the AI robots that will chase them and explode when they get too close. There’s 
										two ways to get out of that place, the easiest is when other player gets the action to bring their teammate back and the hardest one, where the player needs 
										to find terminals that contain a puzzle that once it’s solved may help the user to get out. What makes it hard is that in the maze there are in total six 
										terminals and just two of them have the ability to help the user to return.
										<br>
										<br>

										It is important to mention that if the players lose all their robots or the player within “The Maze” is killed, the game is over.
										<br>
										<br>

										There are many things that we would like to add like randomization of the environment, a better AI behaviour or the assets, unfortunately we are short of
										time and money.
									</p>
									<p>
										On this project my main tasks consist on:
										<ul>
											<li>Documenting project planning, project scope, measures of performance, risk management, etc.</li>
											<li>Creating some visual efects using <b>Niagara System</b>.</li>
											<li>Creating minor functionallity using <b>Blueprints</b>.</li>
											<li>Testing functionallity.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										The video below it's a technical demo that we did on the first days of July. When the project is finished we'll add more and better videos.
