												<h3>Shaped by Change</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Born in one of the world's largest cities, Mexico City, I’ve had the incredible 
												opportunity to live in 14 different cities across four countries—Mexico, 
												Argentina, Guatemala, and Canada—mainly due to my father’s job. Each move 
												has allowed me to immerse myself in different cultures, adapt to new 
												environments, and embrace change with confidence. Through these experiences, 
												I have developed the ability to learn quickly, navigate diverse situations, 
												and see change not as a challenge but as an opportunity for growth.

												<h3>Technology</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Technology has always been a driving force in my life, shaping both my personal 
												growth and professional career. From an early age, my curiosity for innovation 
												ed me to explore different areas of development, from game creation and interactive 
												experiences to enterprise solutions like Salesforce. Working on VR games, interactive 
												applications, and large-scale financial industry projects has given me a deep understanding 
												of how technology can enhance experiences and solve complex problems. Constantly adapting to 
												new tools, frameworks, and methodologies, I see technology not just as a career path but as 
												an ever-evolving landscape where creativity and problem-solving meet.

												<h3>Sports</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Sports have always been a big part of my life, both as a player and a fan. 
												I’m especially passionate about football (soccer), American football, hockey, 
												and Formula 1. Over the years, I’ve played in various teams, most recently 
												during my time at Softtek and in my last year at university. I also had the 
												opportunity to be part of the ITESM Campus Morelia volleyball team for three 
												semesters. Beyond the competition, sports have taught me invaluable lessons—most 
												importantly, the power of teamwork, adaptability, and strategy.

												<h3>Music</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Music has always been an essential part of my life, both as a listener and 
												a creator. I enjoy a wide range of genres, from rock and electronic to 
												classical and jazz. Over the years, I’ve played a few instruments and even 
												collaborated with others in small projects. Music has taught me a lot about 
												discipline, creativity, and collaboration—skills that have translated into 
												my professional life. Just as in music, I believe that in development, 
												every element must work together in harmony, and innovation often comes 
												from combining different influences and perspectives.

												One of my Social Service experiences was at the Museo Memoria y Tolerancia in Mexico City. Usually the main 
												activities for the students consisted of helping the visitors. But my case was different due to my background 
												I was assigned to help on the maintenance and configuration of computer equipment of the museum and the offices and also 
												help in the configuration and installation of audio guides.
